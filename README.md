# ShizenTerrainTools
Shizen Terrain Tools is a Unity plugin that generates Terrain, from the major geographical details, to the minute, such as grass placement. 

There are four sections to Shizen: Height Tools, Texture Tools, Object Tools and Detail Tools. 

Height Tools control the actual 'heights' of the terrain, from mountains to valleys. 

Texture Tools control the automatic and contextual placement of textures on the terrain, placing grass textures on a plain and rock textures on a mountain. 

Object Tools are responsible for autonomously placing objects around a terrain, quickly populating forests and rocky outcrops with 3D objects. 

Detail Tools are responsible for the smaller details of the environment, things like physical grass and flowers.
